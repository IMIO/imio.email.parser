Converts emails to PDFs. See https://github.com/andrewferrier/email2pdf for
more information.

optional arguments:
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        File containing input email you wish to read in raw
                        form delivered from a MTA. If set to '-' (which is the
                        default), it reads from stdin.
  --input-encoding INPUT_ENCODING
                        Set the expected encoding of the input email (whether
                        on stdin or specified with the --input-file option).
                        If not set, defaults to this system's preferred
                        encoding, which is UTF-8.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output file you wish to print the body of the email to
                        as PDF. Should include the complete path, otherwise it
                        defaults to the current directory. If this option is
                        not specified, email2pdf picks a date & time-based
                        filename and puts the file in the directory specified
                        by --output-directory.
  -d OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                        If --output-file is not specified, the value of this
                        parameter is used as the output directory for the body
                        PDF, with a date-and-time based filename attached. In
                        either case, this parameter also specifies the
                        directory in which attachments are stored. Defaults to
                        the current directory (i.e. /srv/venv/email2pdf).
  --no-body             Don't parse the body of the email and print it to PDF,
                        just detach attachments. The default is to parse both
                        the body and detach attachments.
  --no-attachments      Don't detach attachments, just print the body of the
                        email to PDF.
  --headers             Add basic email headers (Subject, From, To, Date) to
                        the first PDF page. The default is not to do this.
  --add-prefix-date     Prepend an ISO-8601 prefix date (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD-) to
                        any attachment filename that doesn't have one. Will
                        search through the whole filename for an existing date
                        in that format - if not found, it prepends one.
  --ignore-floating-attachments
                        Emails sometimes contain attachments that don't have a
                        filename and aren't embedded in the main HTML body of
                        the email using a Content-ID either. By default,
                        email2pdf will detach these and use their Content-ID
                        as a filename, or autogenerate a filename. If this
                        option is specified, it will instead ignore them.
  --enforce-syslog      By default email2pdf will use syslog if available and
                        just log to stderr if not. If this option is
                        specified, email2pdf will exit with an error if the
                        syslog socket can not be located.
  --mostly-hide-warnings
                        By default email2pdf will output warnings about
                        handling emails to stderr and exit with a non-zero
                        return code if any are encountered, *as well as*
                        outputting a summary file entitled
                        <output_PDF_name>_warnings_and_errors.txt and the
                        original email as <output_PDF_name>_original.eml.
                        Specifying this option disables the first two, so only
                        the additional files are produced - this makes it
                        easier to use email2pdf if it is run on a schedule, as
                        warnings won't cause the same email to be repeatedly
                        retried.
  -v, --verbose         Make the output more verbose. This affects both the
                        output logged to syslog, as well as output to the
                        console. Using this twice makes it doubly verbose.
  -h, --help            Show some basic help information about how to use
                        email2pdf.
